# 🔐 Secure Deployment Guide

## Problem Solved ✅

Your authentication credentials are now **completely secure**:
- ❌ **Before**: Credentials were hardcoded and visible in your public GitHub repository
- ✅ **After**: Credentials are in environment variables, hidden from public view

## 🚀 How to Deploy Securely

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)

1. **Deploy the site:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Set environment variables in Netlify:**
   - Go to [https://app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Select your site
   - Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
   - Add these variables:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_EMAILS` = `anishgillella@gmail.com,sana.dharani13@gmail.com`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_VALID_PASSWORD` = `Gillellaanish@123`

3. **Redeploy to apply changes:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

### Option 2: GitHub Pages

1. **Deploy the site:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-github.sh
   ```

2. **No additional setup needed** - Environment variables are automatically included during build.

## 🔍 Verification Steps

1. **Check your public repository** - No credentials should be visible
2. **Test authentication** - Login should work with your credentials
3. **Share the URL** - Only people with the email/password can access

## 🛡️ Security Benefits

- **Public Repository Safe**: Anyone can view your code without seeing credentials
- **Easy Updates**: Change credentials without code changes
- **Multiple Environments**: Different credentials for development/production
- **No Secrets in Git**: Your authentication remains private

## 📋 Environment Variables Reference

### Local Development (.env.local)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_EMAILS=anishgillella@gmail.com,sana.dharani13@gmail.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_VALID_PASSWORD=Gillellaanish@123
```

### Production (Netlify Dashboard)
- **Variable Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_EMAILS`
- **Value**: `anishgillella@gmail.com,sana.dharani13@gmail.com`

- **Variable Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_VALID_PASSWORD`  
- **Value**: `Gillellaanish@123`

## 🎯 Final Result

Your anniversary website is now:
- ✅ **Secure**: Credentials hidden from public view
- ✅ **Functional**: Authentication works exactly the same
- ✅ **Deployable**: Can be deployed safely to any platform
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Easy to update credentials without code changes

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Never commit .env.local** - It's already in .gitignore
2. **Set environment variables on your hosting platform** - Required for production
3. **Test after deployment** - Verify authentication works in production
4. **Keep credentials private** - Only share the final website URL

Your website is now ready for secure deployment! 🎉
